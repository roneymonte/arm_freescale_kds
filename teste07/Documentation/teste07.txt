Module "pin_mux"   (component PinSettings)
   - pin_mux_hardware_init -This method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method in user code to route 
                desired pins into peripherals. The method is useful for reinitialization HW after some routing changes.
   - pin_mux_configure_can_pins -CAN method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into CAN0 peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_cmp_pins -CMP method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into CMP0, CMP1, CMP2 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_enet_pins -ENET method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into ENET peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_gpio_pins -GPIO method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into PTA, PTB, PTC, PTD, PTE peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_i2c_pins -I2C method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into I2C0, I2C1, I2C2 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_i2s_pins -I2S method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into I2S0 peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_jtag_pins -JTAG method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into JTAG peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_llwu_pins -LLWU method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into LLWU peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_rtc_pins -RTC method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into RTC peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_sdhc_pins -SDHC method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into SDHC peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_spi_pins -SPI method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into SPI0, SPI1, SPI2 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_uart_pins -UART method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into UART0, UART1, UART2, UART3, UART4, UART5 peripherals.

Module "MQX1"      (component MQX)

Module "Cpu"       (component MK64FN1M0LL12)
   - Cpu_SetClockConfiguration -Calling of this method will cause the clock configuration change and reconfiguration of all 
                components according to the requested clock configuration setting.
   - Cpu_GetClockConfiguration -Returns the active clock configuration identifier. The method is automatically enabled if more 
                than one clock configuration is enabled in the component.
